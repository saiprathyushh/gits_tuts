hloo..my name is sai Prathyush.I am learning git tutorial .this  is first file og git tutorial.

working directory  --> staging area -> local repository ->remote repository

-> from working directory to the staging area(add) ,only single file can be sent at a time ,but whereas from staging to local(commit) or local to remote (push) all batch of files present in the source file can be sent at a time !

-> to push:
git push -u origin master

-> to add link from local to the remote repo:
git remote add origin <url>

->while you have created for first time a local branch while pushing then you have to set an upstream for that local branch 
 ex:  git push --set-upstream origin copy2
  from next time onwards if you want to push any files from that specific branch just git push is enough as it already knows its paremt branch !
